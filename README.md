As a highly motivated and results-oriented recent graduate with a strong foundation in data engineering principles and a passion for cloud technologies, I am confident that I possess the skills and eagerness to thrive in this role and contribute significantly to our team's success. 

I gained a comprehensive understanding of data engineering concepts, including data modelling, data pipelines, and data warehousing. I have a strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with programming languages like Python and Java. Additionally, I have actively pursued certifications in Azure data services, such as DP-203,AZ-900,DP-900,AI-900. 

I am a quick learner and highly adaptable, with a genuine enthusiasm for staying current with the latest advancements in the field. 
My motivation for seeking new opportunities is to deepen my expertise in Big Data technologies, particularly Spark and Kafka. Although I am not currently part of the Big Data team, I have a solid understanding of the architecture and workflow processes involved.
Enthusiastic and Eager to Learn More:
 • Continuously expanding my Azure skillset by undertaking additional projects. 
• Possess a strong desire to contribute to a team environment and leverage my existing data engineering expertise in the context of Azure.
